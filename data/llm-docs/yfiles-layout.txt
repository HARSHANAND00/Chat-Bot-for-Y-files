# yFiles Layout Algorithms

yFiles offers a comprehensive set of layout algorithms for different graph types and use cases.

## Popular Layout Algorithms

- **Hierarchical Layout**: For directed graphs with flow-like structures
- **Organic Layout**: For general graphs with natural, organic appearance
- **Orthogonal Layout**: For graphs with orthogonal edge routing
- **Tree Layout**: For tree structures
- **Circular Layout**: For circular arrangements

## Layout Configuration

Each layout algorithm can be configured with various parameters to achieve the desired appearance.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// Apply hierarchical layout
const layout = new HierarchicalLayout();
graph.applyLayout(layout);
```
