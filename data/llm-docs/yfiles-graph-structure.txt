# yFiles Graph Structure

Understanding the fundamental graph structure is essential for working with yFiles.

## Core Components

- **Nodes**: Vertices in the graph
- **Edges**: Connections between nodes
- **Labels**: Text annotations
- **Ports**: Connection points for edges

## Graph Model

The graph model in yFiles provides a clean separation between:
- Structure (nodes and edges)
- Presentation (visual appearance)
- Behavior (user interaction)

## Working with Graphs

```typescript
// Create nodes
const node1 = graph.createNode();
const node2 = graph.createNode();

// Create edge
const edge = graph.createEdge(node1, node2);
```
